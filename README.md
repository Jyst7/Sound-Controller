# Sound-Controller
Simple Pi Pico controlled sound/brighness macropad

I was interested in making a new PCB as I haven't made one in a couple months. I wanted to make something practical that I would use in my daily life, I often found myself annoyed by how many different  enues i had to go through to adjust my bolume and brighness so I decided to fix this problem. I also wanted to showcase the pcb because I always enjoy seeing it so I decided tto not make a case for this device.
