## 10/30/2025 - Deciding on the Idea  

 I always have to go through many tiny menues at the corner of my screen manually adjusting my monitor's brightness and system volume. I use these functions constantly, and it always takes up too much time. I thought, there must be a better way.

I've been wanting to design something simple but useful with a Raspberry Pi Pico , and this seemed like the perfect project. I want a macropad that gives me control over sound and brightness.

The basic functions I need are:

Volume Up/Down: A satisfying turn of a knob.

Mute/Unmute: Pressing the knob.

Brightness Up/Down: A second knob for this.

Third Programmable function for macros.
